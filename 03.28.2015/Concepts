Chapter 10: Introducing CSS

-CSS allows us to control the way that html elements appear on a page
-CSS rules contain 2 parts: selector and declaration
  -Selector indicates which elements to apply rule to
  -Declaration indicates what to do to the elements
  
-Internal and External Exclusion of CSS
  -You can directly(internally) include CSS into your html code
  -Or you can indirectly(externally) include CSS into your html code using a link element to indicate where the css file is
  
-CSS is named "Cascading Style Sheets" because of the way that rules "cascade" onto other rules
  -If two rules have the same selector, then the last rule will be applied
  -If one rule is more specific than the other, the that rule will be applied
  
-Inheritance
  -HTML elements inherit css rules, meaning that any child will likely inherit its parent attribute
  -Some elements such as background do not inherit
  -If you want to force inheritance to a child element, then add the attribute to be inherited to the child and declare
    the value of the attribute to be inherit
