Finished about half of chapter 2 
It has been a while since finals has come crashing down, but today I learned about structural and semantic markup.
Specifically:

Semantic Markup
---------------
Bold and Italics - <b> and <i>
Superscript and Subscript - <sup> and <sub>
Whitespace collapsing - browsers automatically collapse extra spaces in text
Line Breaks and Horizontal Rules - <br /> and <hr />
Strong and Emphasis: <strong> and <em>      // Use this to note importance of words to search engines
Quotations: <blockquote> and <q>            // Use blockquote for longer quotes and q for short quotes
Abbreviates: <abbr> Use this element in conjunction with a title element to make text pop up when hovering over words
       Example: <abbr title="As soon as possible"> A.S.A.P </abbr>
