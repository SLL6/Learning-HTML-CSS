-HTML has basic structure to it in that there is a head and body
-Elements are a composition of an ending tag, beginning tag, and anything in between.
-We can use elements to alter the webpage.
-We indicate that code is going to be in html with the <html> tag.

Head
  -We place elements in here if we want them to modify the head of the webpage. Ex. the title
  
Body
  -We place elements in here if we want them to show up in the webpage body. Ex. Text and such.
  
Attributes
  -We can modify elements by giving them attributes. Ex. <p lang="en-us"> This text is in english </p>
